# Lung-Sound-Decomposition-Using-Fourier-Decomposition-Method
The repository contains the MATLAB code for decomposing the non-stationary one dimensional signal into
mono frequency components called as Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).

The Fourier Decomposition method used in the study uses the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
for converting a time domain signal into frequency domain.

The cut off frequencies of the respective IMFs are decided using the dyadic, equal energy and uniform band filter banks.
The code used in the
